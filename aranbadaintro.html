  Religious unity is often hard to see and experience in our world today. From wars that are born of religious differences on a global scale to in fighting within the same religious body at the local level, division in religion is all around us. Even within the same denomination of certain religions, there is so much “we are right and you are wrong” thinking. The ever widening gap of division in religion seems to be at an all time high and the possibility of unity among people of faith seems for now to be a fantasy off in the distance.      
  It has always seemed that if you mention the word intolerance, prejudice or bigotry, the first thing that comes to mind is racial differences. Not so today. Intolerance, prejudice and bigotry are so obvious in religion today that it can’t be missed. The mode of thinking that used to be most evident among people of different races is alive and growing in the world of religion. The thinking  of “Us and Them” that is created by this social  disease of  the heart makes the  chances  for  unity  in the  world of  religion  look  like an impossibility.
 It is my belief that only time can heal this divisive form of religious superiority and prejudice. I say time because I feel that as humanity evolves in its thinking and awareness, the day will come when religion is only used to promote love and unity unlike today where it is very often used as a tool for division. I see the day coming when all people of faith will honor one another and not feel threatened by another faith body that follows a different path to God. As I had noted earlier, it was only sixty years ago that blacks and whites were segregated and only 85 years ago that women, who were seen as the inferior gender, were not allowed to vote.  The notion that one group is superior to another in any way, religion included, needs to be smashed. We’ll need to raise our consciousness once more as we did with blacks, women, and others, that superiority, intolerance and prejudice in religion are cancers that must be rooted out. We still have a long way to go, but with awareness and time, I believe we will ultimately come to a place of religious unity.    
Kae Global Outreach Ministry (vision alive team) “àrà-n-bà-dàafrika” program is one way that this awareness and understanding can be brought to the attention of all religious communities. It is an opportunity for people of faith to learn about other faith traditions and as a result gain new understanding of those who follow a different religious path but live in the same community. Christians, Jews, Muslims, and others will gain an opportunity to learn more about people they have never had a chance to get to know. “àrà-n-bà-dàafrika Music Concerts are a vehicle that  helps to cut through much of the fear and ignorance than many people of faith carry deep in their hearts. By experiencing a “àrà-n-bà-dàafrika Music Concerts” Concert, a new understanding can be born and religious unity has a greater chance to become a reality.  
PURPOSE 
This is a very special community event that is designed to bring all people of faith together in the celebration of music. It is said that music has a unifying language all its own. “àrà-n-bà-dàafrika” 
concerts are designed to bring all congregations in your community together for an interfaith musical concert featuring musical choirs and soloists. In addition, liturgical dance and drama groups can be included to perform in their faith tradition. You are encouraged to involve youth groups as well as adult groups. All that is needed is the desire to build unity in the religious community where you live. People of different faiths, although somewhat different in their approach to worship, most often have like hearts when it comes to seeking God. An “àrà-n-bà-dàafrika Music Concerts will bring the hearts of people of faith to a new sense of understanding and unity with one another. It has been said that music is the universal language. Often the differences that come between people of different faiths come from the words we speak and the interpretations that come from those words. With music, something different happens.  There is a sense of community and a union with God that can come to us through music that often does not happen with words.  On the following pages, you will find an outline for how to make a “àrà-n-bà-dàafrika Music Concerts” Interfaith Concert become a reality in your community.  
This concert aims at bringing people together under a united umbrella of worship. It is not a forum for entertainment but a time to receive from the Lord and a time to stand in the gap, This programme  is  composed of pure Yoruba  gospel music  aimed at giving glory to God and  uplifting our generation and the world at large which will enhance  the  empowerment of  our   youth choirs, church choirs, band, drama group by  bringing back the lost glory of our culture ,our language and our heritage as Yoruba people.
